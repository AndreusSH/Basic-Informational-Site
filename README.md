# Basic Node.js and Express Refresh

This project serves as a refresher for Node.js and Express basics. It is inspired by [The Odin Project's Node.js Basic Informational Site lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-basic-informational-site). The goal is to create a simple web application using Node.js and Express to serve static HTML files and handle basic routing.

## What I Did:

- Set up a basic Express server.
- Created routes to serve static HTML files for different pages (home, about, contact).
- Implemented a custom error page for undefined routes.
- Used middleware functions to log requests.
